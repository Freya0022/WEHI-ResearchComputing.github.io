# Email - Week 4

Hi All,

This is your email to start week 4 of your internship. Now we are expecting you to understand the high-level problem.


## WARNING: Do you have a problem? Please read this first

Many students ask their supervisor questions that could be easily solved within the team. Please read this [to find out when and how to send an email to your supervisor to ask a question](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/faq#how-should-i-ask-for-help-to-solve-a-problem).


## Goals for the week

Please look at [the key milestones and onboarding emails page](emails-and-key-milestones).

## Key things to do before for your regular weekly project meeting

1. Please meet as a team before the meeting without your supervisors to ensure you as a team of students are all on the same page
2. Please send a weekly email update 24 hours before the meeting with: 
  - what each student has done,
  - write down any questions you have for the meeting to use as an agenda,
  - provide a link to the wiki, and 
  - provide a link to the technical notes in Sharepoint
3. Remember to ask to record the meeting to more easily keep notes if needed
4. Document the action items and make sure they are in the weekly email update for next week
