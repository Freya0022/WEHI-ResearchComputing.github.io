# Email - one week before the internship

Hi All,

Welcome to the RCP Student Internship Program at WEHI. We are excited to have you join our team and provide you with valuable learning opportunities throughout your internship.

## WARNING: Please note that you should not turn up to the WEHI building at 9am.

This is a 100% remote internship and that part of the Workday email can be safely ignored. On your first day, you will be scheduled some virtual drop-in sessions so you can meet the supervisor and other interns.

## WARNING: Do not register for an in-person welcome session.

This is for staff who will get keycards to access WEHI and this is a 100% remote internship.

## WARNING: Open Source Contributors

Please note that you won't have access to WEHI resources, including Workday and email. We will ensure that all information is being stored on Github repos that are publicly available.

## WARNING: Read the FAQ before setting up Workday

Workday is the Human Resources software tool at WEHI. You will receive an email from Workday and will need to fill in all the forms before you start. You may not receive the Workday email before your start date. This is OK, you will just need to wait and use your student email for the time being. Please also note that there is a Workday FAQ you can find in the FAQ below.

It is usually an issue with students to have issues with Workday.

## WARNING: Please note that your setup with University of Melbourne may cause confusion in your browser. Please use "Incognito" or "Private" mode when you are troubleshooting.

Please go to [the FAQ and look through all the Workday issues](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/faq#onboarding-onto-the-internship-program-workday) before your start setting up Workday.


## WARNING: Do you have a problem? Please read this first

Many students ask their supervisor questions that could be easily solved within the team. Please read this [to find out when and how to send an email to your supervisor to ask a question](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/faq#how-should-i-ask-for-help-to-solve-a-problem).

## Goals for your first week

Please look at [the key milestones and onboarding emails page](emails-and-key-milestones).


We are looking forward to working with you and wish you a rewarding and successful internship experience.

Regards,

Rowland Mosbergen
